Stochastic (Random) Variable - observation/outcome of simulating some random process

Stochastic Variable takes on certain values from state space

Stochastic Variables often use numerical representations

- I.e. {0,1} instead of heads and tails

Example 1:

Probability of flipping a head or tail is denoted as P(x = 'T') = 0.5
	- X = Stochastic variable representing the observation of an outcome for an experiment (i.e. 'flip a coin')
	- 'T' = a possible outcome that must be an element of the state space (i.e. heads or tails)
