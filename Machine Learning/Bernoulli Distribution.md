Bernoulli Distribution is denoted as ![[Pasted image 20231011164432.png]] 

Example 1 'flip a coin':
	x = 0 : ![[Pasted image 20231011164956.png]]
	x = 1 : ![[Pasted image 20231011165058.png]]
	
		This is what is expected for a biased coin

Example 2:
	If there's a sequence of getting Heads, Tails, Tails such that ![[Pasted image 20231011165451.png]] then the probability is as follows:
		Consider μ as given then ![[Pasted image 20231011165623.png]]

Likelihood - μ is not known and we consider this quantity a function of μ
