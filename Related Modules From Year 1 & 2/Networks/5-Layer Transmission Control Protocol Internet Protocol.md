- Most widely used model for the internet

5 layer stack includes:

- Application layer - contains user code & interface and sends/delivers data to/from the Transport layer (merges the Presentation layer & Session layer from [[7-Layer Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model]])
- Transport layer - contains [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) to prevent raw data packets being corrupted, arriving out of order or not arriving at all
- Network layer - uses Internet Control Message Protocol to describe how data is grouped into datagrams and uses a network addressing scheme
- Link layer - controls how packets are transported between network nodes (e.g. how a device is detected by Wi-Fi network)
- Physical layer - converts data to/from electrical or radio signals (this is sometimes merged with Link layer)
