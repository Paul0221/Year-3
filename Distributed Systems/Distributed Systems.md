Distributed System - a collection of autonomous elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system

Collection of autonomous elements - nodes that need to collaborate together

Autonomous node has its own notion of time that needs synchronisation $^1$ and needs to communicate with other nodes requiring network support

	 $^1$ Because there's no global clock

The collection of nodes need to operate the same

The end user can't tell where computation takes place or where data is stored

Biggest challenge for cloud data centres are overheating however this can be resolved by using underwater data centres

[[Middleware]] layer - brings a set of machines together under the same distributed system

Challenges of Distributed Systems:

- Architecture
- Reliability
- Security
- Scalability
- Fault Tolerance
- Openness
- [[Transparency]]


Types of Distributed Systems:

- [[Distributed Information Systems]]
- [[Distributed Systems for Pervasive Computing]]
- [[High Performance Distributed Systems]]

Software Components - components that constitute the system

Software Architectures - organise various software components

[[System Architectures]] - instantiation of a software architecture

Architectural style is formulated in terms of:

- Replaceable components with well-defined interfaces
- Ways components are connected to each other
- Data exchanged between components
- How these components and connectors are jointly configured into a system

Architectural Styles for Distributed Systems:

- [[Event-Based Architectures]]
- [[Layered Architectures]]
- [[Object-Based Style]]
- [[Resource-Based Architectures]]
