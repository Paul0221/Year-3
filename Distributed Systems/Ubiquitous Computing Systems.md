Ubiquitous Computing Systems - pervasive and continuously present

E.g. continuous interaction between system and user

Core elements of Ubiquitous Computing Systems:

- Distribution - devices are networked, distributed and accessible in a transparent manner
- Interaction - interaction between users and devices is highly unobtrusive
- Context awareness - system is aware of a user's context in order to optimise interaction
- Autonomy - devices operate autonomously without human intervention
- Intelligence - system as a whole can handle a wide range of dynamic actions and interactions
