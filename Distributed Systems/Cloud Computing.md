Computing resources are virtualised and accessed as a service

Layers of Cloud Computing:

- Hardware layer never seen by customers (e.g. processors, routers, power systems & cooling systems)
- Infrastructure layer deploys virtualisation techniques to allocate and manage virtual storage devices & servers
- Platform layer provides higher-level abstractions for storage
- Application layer (e.g. offi)
