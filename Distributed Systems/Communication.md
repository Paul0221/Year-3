Simple abstraction of communication: ![[Pasted image 20231023134159.png]]

In reality, communication is more complex as it uses:

- Various networks (i.e. Wi-Fi, home DSL, cellular data, submarine cables, satellites etc)
- Physical communication (i.e. electric current, radio waves, lasers etc)

Communication has large scale data transfer service:

- Can be installed anywhere
- Provides a data centre in a box
- Often combined with networking capabilities such as edge gateways and smart routers
- High latency and high bandwidth

Latency (i.e. Propagation Delay) - time until message arrives

Bandwidth - data volume per unit time

Time to send a message = Size/Bandwidth + Latency
