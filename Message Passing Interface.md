Message Passing Interface (MPI) is advanced transient messaging

The advent high performance multicomputers caused the need for message-oriented primitives to easily write highly efficient applications

The problem was that most interconnected networks and high performance multicomputers were shipped with proprietary communication libraries which need to be hardware independent

Message Passing Interface is designed for parallel applications and assumes communication takes place within a known group of processes

- MPI makes use of underlying network

[[Message Passing Interface Primitives]] are used for communication
