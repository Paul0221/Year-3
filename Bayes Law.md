### Key Definitions

Joint probability - probability of 2 variables that are not completely independent of each other

Marginal probability - probability of a random variable taking on a specific value regardless of the value the other variable takes on

Conditional probability - probability of a random variable taking on a specific value given the value of the other variable

	Example 1
		We collect heights & weights across the UK population (N individuals) and group them into 'bins' (i.e. categories)
		
		Height = random variable X
		Weight = random variable Y
