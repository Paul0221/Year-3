### Key Definitions

Joint probability - probability of 2 variables that are not completely independent of each other

Marginal probability - probability of a random variable taking on a specific value regardless of the value the other variable takes on

Conditional probability - probability of a random variable taking on a specific value given the value of the other variable

	Example 1
		We collect heights & weights across the UK population (N individuals) and group them into 'bins' (i.e. categories)
		
		Height = random variable X
		Weight = random variable Y
		
		![[Pasted image 20231013134334.png]] = number of individuals with height ![[Pasted image 20231013134453.png]] and weight ![[Pasted image 20231013134609.png]] 
		
		![[Pasted image 20231013134700.png]] = number of individuals with height ![[Pasted image 20231013134453.png]] 
		
		![[Pasted image 20231013134824.png]] = number of individuals with weight ![[Pasted image 20231013134609.png]]
		
		What is the joint probability ![[Pasted image 20231013134957.png]] ?
