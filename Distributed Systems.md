Distributed System - a collection of autonomous elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system

Collection of autonomous elements - nodes that need to collaborate together

Autonomous node has its own notion of time that needs synchronisation $^1$ and needs to communicate with other nodes requiring network support

	 $^1$ Because there's no global clock

The collection of nodes need to operate the same

The end user can't tell where computation takes place or where data is stored

Biggest challenge for cloud data centres are
